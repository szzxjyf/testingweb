We submitted our Bank Kiosk case for WDT funding last year, but it was ultimately not approved. Yesterday, we received an email confirming that we may resubmit the case for this year’s round.

Our understanding is that this initiative does not fall within the GPS value stream and therefore would still not be prioritised under GPS. If that remains the case, we will proceed with the WDT resubmission accordingly. If there has been any change in scope or prioritisation this year, please let us know.
Option A (crisp, exec-style)

Efficiency uplift: Automating routine work could save ~8.38 FTE capacity.

Better client service: Enquiries can be resolved faster and more accurately with a structured knowledge base.

Scalable knowledge reuse: Knowledge distillation turns expert input into reusable assets, enabling consistent, at-scale replication.

Option B (more “business case” wording)

Productivity gains: Reduce manual effort and free up ~8.38 FTE worth of capacity for higher-value work.

Service quality uplift: Standardised answers improve speed, accuracy, and consistency of frontline responses.

Institutionalise expertise: Distill expert know-how into a living knowledge base so it can be reused and continuously expanded across teams.

Option C (slightly more visionary)

Unlock capacity: Shift repeat work to automation, releasing ~8.38 FTE capacity.

Raise service experience: Provide near-instant, reliable answers powered by a well-governed knowledge base.

Make expertise scalable: Distill and codify expert knowledge into a reusable dataset—so the organisation learns once and benefits repeatedly.

If you tell me whether this is for a slide / email / funding proposal, I can tune it to match the format (e.g., more KPI-like, or more narrative).


Qbot currently handles ~7,000–8,000 enquiries per month. To absorb further growth, we need a step-change in the QA knowledge base—enabled by AI-assisted drafting to scale content creation efficiently.

Reducing recurring enquiries is a core GPS priority (Big 5), and this initiative directly supports that agenda by eliminating repeat questions at the source.

Human-in-the-loop, AI–human collaboration amplifies expert productivity—AI generates high-quality drafts, while humans validate and refine—so we can scale impact without compromising accuracy.
