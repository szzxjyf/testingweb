We submitted our Bank Kiosk case for WDT funding last year, but it was ultimately not approved. Yesterday, we received an email confirming that we may resubmit the case for this year’s round.

Our understanding is that this initiative does not fall within the GPS value stream and therefore would still not be prioritised under GPS. If that remains the case, we will proceed with the WDT resubmission accordingly. If there has been any change in scope or prioritisation this year, please let us know.
